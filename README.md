## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

Because this repository is an archive of diverse projects, installation and execution instructions vary by directory. 

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/courses.git](https://github.com/yourusername/courses.git)
   cd courses
   ```

2. **Navigate to a specific project:**
   ```bash
   cd CS333/client-server/win24-cs333-clientserver-main
   ```

3. **Compile and Run (General Guidelines):**
   * **For C/C++ projects:** Most directories include a `Makefile`. Run `make` to compile the source code, then execute the output binary (e.g., `./main`).
   * **For Python projects:** Run using the Python interpreter: `python3 script.py`.
   * **For Rust projects (e.g., CS423):** Use Cargo to build and run: `cargo run`.

*(Please refer to the individual `README.md` files located within specific project subdirectories for detailed instructions).*

## 🚀 Features & Highlights

* **Algorithm Optimization:** Custom-built data structures (like 2-3 trees and Hash Tables) designed for maximum efficiency.
* **Concurrency:** Thread-safe encryption programs demonstrating safe memory management and POSIX threads.
* **Systems Architecture:** Custom client-server applications handling raw network traffic using C sockets.
* **Language Design:** Fully functional parsers and interpreters built from scratch to parse abstract syntax trees.
* **Modern Tooling:** Utilization of Rust's robust ownership model for safe, concurrent simulation systems.
